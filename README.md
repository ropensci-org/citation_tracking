## rOpenSci Citation Tracking

Tracking citations of rOpenSci packages. 

Right now this is done through Google Scholar alerts. The packages tracked are in the file [packages.txt][], and the separate alerts are in [alerts.txt][].

[maybe.txt][] has the pkgs to consider tracking but that are not currently tracked.

[dont-track.txt][] has the pkgs to consider tracking but that are not currently tracked.

I get email notifications - disregard false alarms - for real hits, collect the pdf if there is one, and put an entry in our list of citations. Eventually citations end up at <https://github.com/ropensci-org/ropensci_citations>
